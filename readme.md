# shipyard-ts

This is a reimplementation of the rust library [`shipyard`](https://docs.rs/shipyard)

It shares a very similar API, but has none of the performance benefits of a SparseSet at this time.

I've written it to help others with TypeScript experience understand how the shipyard ECS works.
